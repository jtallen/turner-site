# Tech Stack

This website is built using some of the newer technologies that I am excited about:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for my React framework.
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployment and CI/CD.
- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for third-party email functionality.

# Usage

- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/jtallen/turner-site.git`
- Install modules using `npm install` or `yarn`
- Run local development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

# Deployment

Deployment is accomplished using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which deploys directly from this GitHub repo and automatically re-deploys after every push. Try it out - it's free, and great!
